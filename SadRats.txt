In the land of the Sad Rats, an evil overlord, the Rat King, has arrived. 
This whiskered tyrant threatens to snatch away all the leftover food left in 
the realm. As the chosen lone mousekateer, armed with only a humble sword, your 
quest is to find and conquer the Rat King, save all the leftovers, and decide 
the fate of the land of the Sad Rats. Your journey begins with a simple blade, 
but the realm holds greater weapons for a mousekateer of your caliber.
